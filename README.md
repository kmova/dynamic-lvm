## Overview

OpenEBS Local PV LVM is a [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) plugin for implementation of [LVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)) backed persistent volumes for Kubernetes. It is a local storage solution, which means the device, volume and the application are on the same host. It doesn't contain any dataplane, i.e only its simply a control-plane for the kernel lvm volumes. It mainly comprises of two components which are implemented in accordance to the CSI Specs:

1. CSI Controller - Frontends the incoming requests and initiates the operation.
2. CSI Node Plugin - Serves the requests by performing the operations and making the volume available for the initiator.

## Why OpenEBS Local PV LVM?

1. Lightweight, easy to set up storage provisoner for host-local volumes in K8s ecosystem.
2. Makes LVM stack available to K8s, allowing end users to use the LVM functionalites like snapshot, thin provisioning, resize, etc for their Persistent Volumes.
3. Cloud native, i.e based on CSI spec, hence suitable for all K8s deployments.

## Architecture

LocalPV refers to storage that is directly attached to a specific node in the Kubernetes cluster. It uses locally available disks (e.g., SSDs, HDDs) on the node.

<b>Use Case</b>: Ideal for workloads that require low-latency access to storage or when data locality is critical (e.g., databases, caching systems).

### Characteristics:

- <b>Node-bound</b>: The volume is tied to the node where the disk is physically located.
- <b>No replication</b>: Data is not replicated across nodes, so if the node fails, the data may become inaccessible.
- <b>High performance</b>: Since the storage is local, it typically offers lower latency compared to network-attached storage.

The diagram below depicts the mapping to the host disks, the LVM stack on top of the disks and the kubernetes persistent volumes to be consumed by the workload. Local PV LVM CSI Controller upon creation of the Persistent Volume Claim, creates a LVMVolume CR, which emits an event for Local PV LVM CSI Node Plugin to create the LV(logical volume). When workloads are scheduled the Local PV LVM CSI Node Plugin makes this zvol/dataset available via a mount point on the host.
