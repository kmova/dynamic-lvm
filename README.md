CSI driver for provisioning Local PVs backed by LVM and more.

## Project Status

Currently the LVM CSI Driver is in alpha.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before installing LVM driver please make sure your Kubernetes Cluster
must meet the following prerequisites:

1. all the nodes must have lvm2 utils installed
2. volume group has been setup for provisioning the volume
3. You have access to install RBAC components into kube-system namespace.
   The OpenEBS LVM driver components are installed in kube-system namespace
   to allow them to be flagged as system critical components.

### Supported System

K8S : 1.17+

OS : Ubuntu

LVM : 2

### Setup

Find the disk which you want to use for the LVM, for testing you can use the loopback device

```
truncate -s 1024G /tmp/disk.img
sudo losetup -f /tmp/disk.img --show
```

Create the Volume group on all the nodes, which will be used by the LVM Driver for provisioning the volumes

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/loop0
sudo vgcreate lvmvg /dev/loop0
```

### Installation

Deploy the Operator yaml 

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/master/deploy/lvm-operator.yaml
```

### Deployment

deploy the sample fio application 

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/lvm-localpv/master/deploy/sample/fio.yaml
```
