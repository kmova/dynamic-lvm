Drop the STDERR stream contents from output to avoid JSON mangling.

The vgs command may print non-critical warnings to STDERR. Warnings may not
necessarily result in a failure return code, which allows the program to
continue with marshalling the JSON-formatted output. Combining this stream with
STDIN will cause the next step at decodeVgsJSON() to fail due to garbage mixed
in the JSON.
