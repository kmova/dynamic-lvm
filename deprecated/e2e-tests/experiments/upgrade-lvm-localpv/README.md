## About this experiment

This experiment upgrades the lvm-localpv driver components from any previous version to the latest desired stable version or to the develop branch ci images. 

## Supported platforms:

K8S : 1.18+

OS : Ubuntu

LVM version : LVM 2

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s nodes should be ready.
- Do not provision/deprovision any volumes during the upgrade, if we can not control it, then we can scale down the openebs-lvm-controller stateful set to zero replica which will pause all the provisioning/deprovisioning request. And once upgrade is done, the upgraded Driver will continue the provisioning/deprovisioning process.

## Exit-Criteria

- lvm-driver should be upgraded to desired version.
- All the components related to lvm-localpv driver including lvm-controller and csi node-agents should be running and upraded to desired version as well.
- All the lvm volumes should be healthy and data prior to the upgrade should not be impacted.
- After upgrade we should be able to provision the volume and other related task with no regressions.

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of upgrading lvm-localpv driver, clone openens/lvm-localpv[https://github.com/openebs/lvm-localpv] repo and then first apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f lvm-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f lvm-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.
After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <upgrade-lvm-localpv-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er upgrade-lvm-localpv -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er upgrade-lvm-localpv -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
